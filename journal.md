# Journal Entry For Week One

**Instructions** : In a new text document, jot down some reflections -narrative, or bullet points, both are fine. Call it ‘journal.md’ This document also goes into your week one repo on github. Detail any issues you had with getting started, any parts that caused you difficulty. If you got any error messages while trying to get set up, copy those into your reflection; google them. Do you find any websites that help you? What kind of ‘failures’ might you have encountered this week?

## Issues I Had Getting Started

- Overall, there were no major issues in setting everything up. I am fortunate enough to be in a program that has a heavy reliance on various "techy tools", so the need to install and make accounts on various new products is not a foreign concept for me!
- I did not encounter any error messages this week!

- **Setting up Github**: 
  - I will say, this platform has a slight learning curve as the *markdown language* is new, but I find myself enjoying learning it! As the weeks go by, I hope to make each week's pages more structured and nicely laid out that the last. Next week, I want to explore more online markdown guides or maybe see how other people online "design" their pages. 
  - Actually setting up the repository and designated pages was no issue. With the profs instructions, it was fairly straight foward. The tutorial was easy to follow and there were no obstacles to overcome (for now).
  
- **Setting up Hypothesis**:
  - Again, no major issues with this tool. The instructions were easy to follow and I was able to sign-up and join the group easily enough.
  - I find myself a little bit nervous to log some of my thoughts and perspectives on the readings because I feel like they are a little bit off base. I have always been taugh to look at the design of things and data representation methods rather than the content itself... which is what I find myself focusing on. I am hoping s the weeks and lessons continue, I will adapt a little more to looking at the information rather than designs. I am excited to view things in a nw perspective, I think it will help me alot in my future courses as well.
  
  **Setting up Zotero**
  - No issues downloading and setting up this tool.
  - I think the main issue is me rushing through the instructions too quickly.
  - As well, I am not use to saving information just because it is interesting, so that is a new research technique I need to get used to.
  
  ## Websites That Helped Me
- I mainly just used the tutorial or guide sites presented in this weeks lesson plan
  
- https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/
  - I used this to help me organize and design my Github pages
    
- https://web.hypothes.is/quick-start-guide-for-students/
  - I used this to help set up and learn Hypothesis
    
- https://uclalibrary.github.io/slides/tutorial-zotero-intro.html#/
  - I used this to learn Zotero
    
  ## Any Failures I Ran into This Week
  
- The main failure I think I ran into this week was the "asking for questions" task. I can not quite explain why I got so confused by the task, but I really am. I am going to re attempt it after I finish this post. I tried reading through the discord page for week one as well but I think I got overwhelmed alittle bit... but depending on what I submit for this week, I guess we'll see if I figure it out.
- I am used to asking questions in person or making sed of those office hours and I have never been great at emails or online forums. So this is great practice for me!
   - P.S: The irony behind me needing to ask a question aboyt a task teaching us to ask a question is not lost on me either!
   
# Final Reflections

**Instructions** : Drawing on your annotations of what you’ve read (and/or your notes from what you’ve listened to), discuss your idea of what ‘digital history’ might be prior to starting this course, and think through whether any of the materials we’ve seen this week confirm or upset those notions. What kinds of ‘digital silences’ did you encounter? What has excited you? Finally, where do you want to go, with digital history?

## Define Digital History *PRIOR* to Completing This Course
- Going into this course, I honestly did not think too much about what I was getting myself into! I read the brief description on Carleton Central and impulsively signed up. 
- After having everyone ask me what it is that I am doing, I sorta defined *Digital History* as:
- Displaying historical narratives on a a new, visual platform. I think of it as translating traditional physical/hardcopy records of history onto an online platform in ways that are more inviting and clearly displayed than before.
- Honestly, I know that decription has a lot to do with my background studies, but I am interested to see how my understanding of the subject develops as the course continues.
- So far, after this weeks reading, I think generally my description is correct but I am for sure mising a whole aspect as to what "digital history" encompasses. Although we were shown how the concept has developped and various examples of it (especially in the open source archive Twitter thread), I am learnng not every example of it displays the information is a "new fashion". Some websites or online archives, simply store th information in a way that makes it more accisible to everyone which is it's own purpose entirely.

## What kind of Digital Silences did I encounter?
- I think one of the most interesting things I encountered this week was the entire concept of " archive silences". I think my favourite assigned reading was actually the Twitter Thread offering insght to this concept.
- I mentioned it in an annotation in Hypothesis, but in high school I always disliked my history course because I felt like the lessosn were missing dimension and perspectives from all sides. 
- So ultimately, I found it really interesting to explore the websites and archives depicting the "hidden" side of the stories.
- I especially liked https://www.digitaltransgenderarchive.net/, for both the content and layout.

## Where Do I want to Go With Digital History?
- I am not completely sure where I want to go with digital history, but I will say I am excited to get there!
- It has oly been a week, but I can tell the lessons I will learn both from a technological standpoint ad=nd reasearch standpoint will greatly improve the way I navigate my future courses in my program.
- Every year, we have a partnership with a Museum in Ottawa to create some sort of digital story telling prototype that shares a narrative of our chosen exhibit or art piece. In my group, I am always the weakest at researching what content to present and build from. I am hoping after completing this course, I will improve those skills to create even better projects with more focused narratives based on my research.
