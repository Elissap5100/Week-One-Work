### **Title**: Demo Help Request: Command Prompt Issue 

I ran into this problem when working on the "Asking For Help" task in our Week One Lesson Plan. Below is a snip-it of the error I encountered:

I followed the instructions offered in the lesson plan and inputted the git **commit -m "this is just a test"** line of code into the command prompt as described and hit enter, but came up with the error listed in the image above. 

I am not sure were to go from here and any help or advice would be greatly appreciated. If you need any further information to helo solve the problem, just let me know!
