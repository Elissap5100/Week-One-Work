# Week One - Notes

**Instructions** : Being a digital historian means keeping track of what you’ve done, as a gift to your future self (ie, so that when you come back to something, you can pick up where you left off). Make a new text document, and put into it any new terms you’ve encountered, commands you used, error messages you encountered, websites that helped, and so on: this document is a scrap book, as it were. Bullet points and memos-to-self are fine. Put this text document into your week one repo on github, along with any other files or digital things you happen to make. Call it your ‘notes.md’.

## Websites That Helped Me:
- https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/
  - I used this guide website to help me structure my notes and journal page a small bit! It was very easily navigated and got straight to the point with easy to understand instructions. This week was a bit hective for me, but next week I hope to buckle down and learn a bit more about the mark-down language and maybe style my pages abit more.

## Websites of Note:
- https://www.digitaltransgenderarchive.net/
  - As a Media production and design major, I tend to do a lot of research... and I'' be honest. I am most attracted to mediums (such as this site) that are layed out in an aesthetically pleaseing manor and easily navigated. This does both and it has content I would love to explore at a later time!
- https://www.saada.org/browse
  - Same idea with this one, I especially found the data encoded maps really interesting and I definetly want to check these out more later.
- https://www.livingstoneonline.org/about-this-site
  - This digital archive had information I had touched upon in class and I want to furhter explore some of the content. I especially found the "The Design of Livingstone Online" page interesting. It is cool to see the thought process behind the creation/ vivion of the online platform (again, it is what I study and I find it fascinating)!

## Errors or Problems I Encountered:
- No error messages this week
- The only technical "problem" I encountered was with Zotero, but it was essentially me not truely understanding it's purpose/rushing throuh the clearly layed out instructions. I am not used to recording information as I go without truly kowing the end purpose... so it is a component of this class I am slowly adapting to. I hope to be alittle more on the ball next week with this. I also am going to brush up on the instructions to familiarize myself with it more!
